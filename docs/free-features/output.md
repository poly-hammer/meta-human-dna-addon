# Output

Export your changes back to the `.dna` file format so you can update your MetaHuman in Unreal Engine.

## Component

Choose which component to export — **Head** or **Body**. The asset list and options update to match.

## Method

| Method                         | When to use                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Calibrate** *(recommended)*  | Your vertex indices and bone names match the original DNA. Calibrates your bone and mesh changes into a new DNA. |
| **Overwrite** *(experimental)* | Your vertex indices or bone names differ from the original DNA. Only use when calibration isn't possible.        |

!!! warning
    **Overwrite** is new and experimental — it doesn't work in every case yet.

## Asset List

Lists the meshes, armatures, and images that will be exported. Uncheck any asset to exclude it, and edit the name on the left inline.

!!! note
    Mesh names must follow the MetaHuman **LOD naming convention** so the exporter knows which LOD each mesh belongs to.

## Options

- **Run Validations** — check the data before writing the DNA.
- **Update LODs** *(Pro)* — recalibrate lower LODs from your LOD0 changes.
- **Align Head and Body** *(Calibrate)* — align overlapping head/body bones to avoid a seam.

## Output Folder

A single folder where everything is written. The `.dna` components go here, and textures export to a `Maps` subfolder.

!!! note
    If your `.blend` is saved, you can use Blender's relative path syntax to help standardize your export folder. For example, setting `//Ada` will output your `head.dna`, `body.dna`, and `Maps` folder into a folder named `Ada` next to your `.blend` file.

## Export Buttons

- **Only Component** — export just the selected component (head or body) to a single DNA file, with no textures or supporting files. Fast when you only need to update one component's DNA.
- **MetaHuman Creator** — export the head and body DNA plus textures in a format MetaHuman Creator accepts. This is the best way to output all the data for your MetaHuman.

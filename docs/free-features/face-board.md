# Face Board

The face board is another Blender armature object, but more importantly, its pose bones are the [GUI Controls](../terminology.md#gui-controls) that RigLogic evaluates into a facial expression. This panel drives it with ready-made poses and options for eye and head behavior.

To pose the board by hand, select the face board armature, enter **Pose Mode**, and grab the yellow controls.

## Pose Library

Pick a pose from the thumbnail preview or the dropdown to set the face board controls to that expression. Poses cover **visemes, emotions, wrinkle map bases, and scan reference** shapes. These are a fast way to understand what a MetaHuman's rig can do, and what data you need to extract from your scans.

- **Category** filters the list (All, Visemes, Emotions, Wrinkle Maps, Scan Reference).
- The **filter** popover (funnel icon) narrows poses by tag, matching **All** or **Any** of the selected tags.
- The **search** button (magnifier) opens a searchable pose picker.

!!! tip
    The wrinkle map poses (`wrinkle_map_01`–`03`) make good base shapes for high-poly sculpts or scans that you later bake down to the texture maps in your material.

## Eye & Head Options

| Option | Effect |
| ------ | ------ |
| Use Eye Aim | Drive the eyes with an aim target instead of the GUI eye controls |
| Eyes Follow Head | Make the eye aim follow head movement |
| Face Board Follow Head | Make the GUI controls follow head movement |

## Importing Animation

Importing face board animation from MetaHuman Animator is done under the [Animation](./animation.md) panel.

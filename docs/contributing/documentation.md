# Documentation
All documentation is referenced in and deployed to our docs mono repo via git submodules: 

[https://github.com/poly-hammer/poly-hammer-docs](https://github.com/poly-hammer/poly-hammer-docs)

The finally docs build can be seen here:


[https://docs.polyhammer.com](https://docs.polyhammer.com)

## Testing Locally
The documentation sites are static html sites that are generated using [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/). To get the docs working locally run these commands:

``` shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
mkdocs serve
```

The site should now be available to preview at:

# Development

Contributions are welcome! Please create an issue to discuss significant work before starting. Open all PRs to the `dev` branch.

## Pull Request Process

1. Fork the repository and create a branch matching the issue name.
2. Add the feature/fix with accompanying unit tests.
3. Run tests and ensure all pass.
4. Submit PR to `dev` with updated documentation.

!!! note
    New features require accompanying unit tests to be approved.

## Prerequisites

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) (recommended for pre-configured profiles)
- [Python 3.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3117/)
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) (Python package manager)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/win) with Git LFS
- [Blender 4.5+](https://www.blender.org/download/)

## Setup

### Using UV (Recommended)

```bash
# pip install uv (if not installed) however system wide install is more ideal. (See instal link above)
pip install uv

# Create venv and install dependencies
uv sync

# Install pre-commit hooks
uv run pre-commit install
```

### Using VS Code

1. Open the workspace - VS Code will prompt to install recommended extensions from `.vscode/extensions.json`
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
3. Restart VS Code
4. Run `> Python: Select Interpreter` and choose `.venv/Scripts/python.exe`

## Build Tasks

Launch Blender/Unreal through VS Code build tasks (`CTRL+SHIFT+B`) to enable dev dependencies and debugging.

!!! note
    Selecting "debug" will hang the app until you attach via debugpy in VS Code.

!!! note
    Override executable paths via `.env`: `UNREAL_EXE_PATH`, `UNREAL_PROJECT`, `BLENDER_EXE_PATH`

## Launch Actions

Use `Python Debugger: Attach` to connect to Blender after launching from build tasks.

## Reloading Addon Code

**Blender** (when launched from VS Code):

```python
from poly_hammer_utils.helpers import reload_addon_source_code
reload_addon_source_code(['meta_human_dna'])
```

## Code Quality

All code is checked via pre-commit hooks and CI:

- **Ruff**: Linting and formatting (configured in `pyproject.toml`)
- **CSpell**: Spell checking (configured in `cspell.json`)
- **Pyright**: Type checking (configured in `pyproject.toml`)

Run checks manually:

```bash
uv run pre-commit run --all-files
uv run ruff check .
uv run ruff format --check .
```

## Type Stubs (Optional)

For better IDE autocomplete with `bpy`, install type stubs into a **separate** virtual environment:

```bash
uv venv .stubs-venv
uv pip install --python .stubs-venv/Scripts/python.exe -e ".[stubs]"
```

!!! warning
    Do not install stubs into the main `.venv`—they conflict with the real `bpy` package.
